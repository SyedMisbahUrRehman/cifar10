. Implement Auto Encoder architecture of CIFAR 10 dataset as provided in the below link.
 Cifar10 Auto Encoder | Kaggle
2. Repeat the same architecture in Q1 by replacing the filter (number of kernels in convolution
layer) combination to (64,32,16) for encoder part and (16,32,64) for decoder.
3. Repeat the same architecture in Q1 by replacing the filter combination to (YOUR CHOICE) for
encoder part and (YOUR CHOICE) for decoder.
4. Compare the results of Q1, Q2, and Q3. Additionally, provide your thoughts which architecture
is best autoencoder.
5. Implement Denoising Auto Encoder architecture on CIFAR 10 dataset as provided in the below
link

6. Change the noise parameters in ‘add_noise_and_clip_data’ function to YOUR CHOICE and
rerun the Q5
